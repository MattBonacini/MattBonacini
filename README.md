## Hi there, I'm Matt 👋

I'm a full-stack developer and WordPress consultant. Most things in this profile will be all about WordPress.

👨‍💻 I'm a full-time freelancer and I'm always looking for new interesting projects. My primary skill is full-stack web development. I also have experience with UI design and prototyping, and I use Figma for that.

Despite I do mostly development work for clients, my design experience helps me to keep an eye for detail, and to consult with clients to improve their conversion rates, MRR, churn rate, and other metrics. If you get a chance to read/view the content I publish online, you will notice that I'm obsessed in building stuff that brings you real business benefits.

Since 2022, after an eternity spent exclusively on client projects, I've also started working on some personal side projects, for example, [Coffee Radar](https://coffeeradar.io/).

### Who do I work with, and what do I do?

💼 Most of my clients are small businesses from the US. I'm based in Europe, born and raised in Italy, so how did that happen? I've been part of Codeable since 2019 (a top-class freelancing platform), and most of the clients there are from the US, EST timezone. The clients that contact me via LinkedIn, YouTube, and even via Reddit, are also usually from the US.

The bulk of my work with clients involves crafting custom themes and plugins. Typically, my clients are e-commerce sites, affiliate marketing websites, or e-learning platforms, all of which utilize WordPress as an integral part of their business operations. 

Via Codeable I've also worked with clients from the UK, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Panama, China, and more.

### Side projects

🔭 Coffee Radar: a WordPress-based website that helps you find the best coffee houses / cafes around the world. I'm building this for remote workers that want to find a public place to work from, and for coffee lovers.

📹 I also have a YouTube channel. Here I share tips and tutorials for WordPress, specifically for online business owners: https://www.youtube.com/@wordpressadvisor/
