## Hi there, I'm Matt üëã

I'm a full-stack developer and WordPress consultant. My main tech stack is PHP and vanilla Javascript, but I also work with Astro, React, NodeJS, and a bunch of other technologies. 

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a full-time freelancer and I'm always looking for new interesting projects. My primary skill is full-stack web development. I also have experience with UI design and prototyping, and I use Figma for that.

Despite I do mostly development work for clients, my design experience helps me to keep an eye for detail, and to consult with clients to improve their conversion rates, MRR, churn rate, and other metrics. If you get a chance to read/view the content I publish online, you will notice that I'm obsessed in building stuff that brings you real business benefits.

Since 2022, after an eternity spent exclusively on client projects, I've also started working on some personal side projects, I've listed some of them at the bottom of this page.

### Who do I work with, and what do I do?

[On my business website you can check out the services I currently offer](https://wordpressadvisor.io/)
[What I'm working on right now (updated every month or so)](https://wordpressadvisor.io/now)

üíº Most of my clients are small businesses from the US. I'm based in Europe, born and raised in Italy, so how did that happen? I've been part of Codeable since 2019 (a top-class freelancing platform), and most of the clients on the platform are from the US, EST time zone. The clients that contact me via LinkedIn, YouTube, and even via Reddit, are also usually from the US.

The bulk of my work with clients involves crafting custom themes and plugins. Typically, my clients are e-commerce sites, affiliate marketing websites, or e-learning platforms, all of which utilize WordPress as an integral part of their business operations. 

I've also worked with clients from the UK, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Panama, China, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and more.

### Side projects

[üî• Reach Kit](http://reachk.it/): turn one-take voice recordings into LinkedIn posts. Capture your ideas everywhere and transform them into content in seconds. It helps you post consistently on LinkedIn. Built with Astro, React and NodeJS.

[üî≠ Coffee Radar](https://coffeeradar.io/): a free WordPress-based website that helps you find the best specialty coffee shops around the world. I'm building this for remote workers that want to find a public place to work from, and for coffee lovers.

Useful Content App: programmatic SEO app that helps to increase impressions on search engines via content created automatically. Built with Astro and Qwik. This app is for private use only and it provides a system powered by a variety of generative AI models to include some AI content on Coffee Radar and to help organize the coffee shops.

### YouTube and LinkedIn

üìπ I have a micro YouTube channel where I share tips and tutorials for WordPress, specifically for online business owners: https://www.youtube.com/@wordpressadvisor/

üìù I write new posts daily on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattbonacini/) about WordPress, web development, and everything revolving around online business websites.
