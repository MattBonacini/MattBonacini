## Hi there, I'm Matt 👋

I'm a front-end developer and WordPress consultant. Most things in this profile will be all about WordPress.

👨‍💻 I'm a full-time freelancer and I'm always looking for new interesting projects. My primary skill is front-end web development. Since the beginning of 2022, I found myself doing also a lot of backend work. But I'm not brave enough to call myself a full stack developer just yet. I also have experience with UI design and prototyping. I use Figma for that.

Despite I do mostly development work for clients, I think my design experience helps me to keep an eye for detail, and to consult with clients to improve their conversion rates and other metrics. If you get a chance to read/view the content I put online, you will notice that I'm obsessed in building stuff that brings you real business benefits.

### Who do I work with?

💼 Most of my clients are small businesses from the US. I'm based in Europe, born and raised in Italy, so how did that happen? I've been part of Codeable since 2019 (a top-class freelancing platform), and most of the clients there are from the US, EST timezone. The clients that contact me via LinkedIn, YouTube, and even via Reddit, are also usually from the US.

Via Codeable I've also worked with clients from the UK, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Panama, China, and more.

### Side projects

🔭 As a side project, I'm currently building Coffee Radar, a WordPress-based website that helps you find the best coffee houses / cafes around the world. I'm building this for remote workers that want to find a public place to work from, and for coffee lovers.

📹 I also have a YouTube channel. Here I share tips and tutorials for WordPress, specifically for online business owners: https://www.youtube.com/@wordpressadvisor/
